# WhatsInTheFridge

A mobile app developed in Android Studio as an assignment for the Mobile Computing module in University of Lincoln

WhatInTheFridge, gives users recipies based on the ingredients in their fridge (inputted into the app by the user)

The ingredients are sent to the recipepuppy API, which then sends a list of recipes that use the ingredients stated by the user.
